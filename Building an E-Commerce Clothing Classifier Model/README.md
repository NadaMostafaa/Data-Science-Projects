Define a CNN classifier with the following layers:
Convolution layer of kernel size 3 and stride 1.
RectiLinear unit activation layer.
Max pooling layer of kernel size 2 and stride 2.
Fully connected layer with the appropriate input and output dimensions.
Train your CNN on the given train_data using a suitable optimizer.
Only run your training loop for 1 or 2 epochs to keep the run time down.
Test your CNN on the given test_data storing your predictions in a list called predictions.
Calculate the accuracy, and per-class precision and recall for your trained classifier on the test_data.
Store your answers in variables accuracy, precision, and recall respectively. Use lists of the appropriate length for the precision and recall
